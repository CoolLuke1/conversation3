    <p><h2>What are your thoughts on the fall of Constantinople in 1453?</h2></p>
    <img src="images/constantinople.jpg" alt="Constantinople">
    <p><h3>Many people have a lot of thoughts about the fall of Constantinople because it was such a pivotal point in history.</h3> 
        Constantinople was taken over by the Ottoman Empire in 1453. The Ottomans, led by Sultan Mehmed II, 
        besieged the city for months until they breached the walls and captured it. this marked the end of the Byzantine Empire. 
        It's a fascinating moment in history! The Ottomans attacked Constantinople by using various tactics, including building massive
        cannons to bombard the city walls and launching naval attacks from the sea. They also dug tunnels underneath the walls to weaken them. 
        It was a combination of military strategy and advanced weaponry that helped them conquer the city. The people of Constantinople
        fought back bravely, but they were outnumbered and outmatched by the Ottoman forces. They defended the city by using their own 
        cannons, arrows, and Greek fire, a powerful incendiary weapon. However, despite their efforts they couldn't withstand the prolonged 
        siege and ultimately the Ottomans overpowered them. The defenders showed great courage in the face of adversity.

    <p><h2>What is your favorite species of endangered tree from Brazil?</h2></p>
    <img src="images/Private-Custom-Travel-Design-Brazil-Amazon-River-Green.webp" alt="Rainforest in Brazil">
    <p><h3>There are many species of trees in Brazil and the topic of endangered trees is interesting to many people.</h3></p>
    <p>Nobody truly knows the exact number of endangered trees from Brazil because there are a significant number of endangered species from
        Brazil. The significant number of endangered species is due to deforestation and habitat loss. One example of an endangered tree 
        from Brazil is the Brazilian Rosewood tree. It is my personal favorite species of endangered tree from Brazil because it is a 
        beautiful color and a very hard wood. It was used to make many fretboards on a lot of guitars but since it has become endangered
        people have been using Indian Rosewood from India to save and preserve the Brazilian rosewood tree.

<p><h2>Did you know that we are living in the year 1726?</h2></p>
<img src="images/otto.jpg" alt="Otto III">
<p><h3>Most people believe that we are in the year 2023 but there is clear evidence against that.</h3></p>
<p>In the year 703 Otto III was going to rise to power. Pope Sylvester II, Otto III, and Constantine VII wanted Otto III to rule on the holy year of 1,000. They all 
  worked together on making fake documents to make it seem like it was the year 1,000. The only issue is that there are no artifacts, major wars or battles, or any physical 
  evidence that the 297 year period even existed.

<p><h2>Did you know that the tomb of Sennefer is also called the "tomb of the grapevines"?</h2></p>
<img src="images/sennefer.jpg" alt="Tomb of Sennefer">
<p><h3>Sennefer was the mayor of Thebes during the reign of Amenhotep II.</h3></p>
<p>The location of Thebes is around 500 miles south of the Mediterranean Sea on the Nile River. The reason it is called the "tomb of the
   grapevines" is because of the decorative motif of bunches of grapes painted on the ceiling. Not only are there grapes on the
   ceiling of his tomb, but there are also paintings of all of his deceased wives.

<p><h2>Did you know that The Leaning Tower of Pisa was built over a period of 199 years?</h2></p>
<img src="images/leaning tower of pisa.jpg" alt="The Leaning Tower of Pisa">
<p><h3>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a popular tourist attraction in Pisa, Italy.</h3></p>
<p>August 9, 1173 was when ground was broken for the construction of a bell tower for a church. This bell tower was designed to have seven
 bells. Each bell sounded a note of the major scale. Bell towers were used for many things including calling people to come for church, 
 counting the years someone had lived when there was a funeral, being struck every hour or quarter-hour, sounded if there was a fire, or 
 warned of any incoming invasions. The original architect behind the tower was Bonanno Pisano. He was an Italian Sculptor that mixed 
 Byzantine and Classical styles of sculpting. He began his construction in 1173 and the first floor has 15 columns around it. 
 After three floors were built in 1178, construction stopped due to unstable subsoil. If construction hadn't stopped, the ground wouldn't 
 have been able to settle and the tower would've fallen. 100 years later, architect Giovanni di Simone continued construction of the tower. 
 He stopped his work on the tower in 1298 since it was still leaning. 60 years later, Tommaso Pisano started his work on the tower and 
 finished construction in 1172. In 1835, architect Alessandro Gheradardesca made the first restoration to the tower by replacing the subsoil 
 with a large marble base. The tower is 55.86 meters tall and weighs 14,700 tons. The tower has a 3.97 degree tilt. The tower was also used
 by people that are very well known. Some well known people that used the tower were Galileo Galilei and the Nazis. Galileo dropped two 
 cannon balls of different weights to prove that they'd fall at the same rate. The Nazis used the tower as a watch tower during World War II. 
 The Allies didn't destroy the tower because it is a magnificent piece of art despite the fact that the Nazis took advantage of it. A good 
 reason to visit it is that it has an interesting history and is a magnificent piece of art.
